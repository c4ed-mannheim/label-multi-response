# Labelling multiple response variable with choice labels
### SurveyCTO
Holds do-file that takes the option labels from the SurveyCTO form and labels the dataset

The SurveyCTO generated do-file labels variables but struggles with "select multiple" variables. It labels these variables but the labels are simply the name of the variable so are uninformative. This do-file labels these "select multiple" variables by first reading relevant portions from the questionnaire. We'd suggest you download the questionnaire from SurveyCTO to a dedicated location and then modify the "select multiple" questions. If questions and/or response options are too long, this script might not work.
